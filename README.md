TextMate Protocol Handler (txmt://) for IntelliJ IDEA (Mac OS X)
=============

Based on [txmt-rubymine](https://github.com/artemf/txmt-rubymine) with improvements for handling paths with spaces and parenthesis

Ideal for handling TextMate urls (txmt://) from helpers such as [better_errors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors), [rails_panel](https://github.com/dejan/rails_panel) and [rails-footnotes](https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes).


### Installation

Simply download `IntelliJTextMateHandler.zip` somewhere safe and run it. You may need to write click on the app for it to run (not signed).

### Source code & Contributing

See this app's source code in `IntelliJTextMateHandler.scpt`. This is just an AppleScript app with some tweaks to open txmt:// url's

Send changes to `IntelliJTextMateHandler.scpt`, not the app itself.
